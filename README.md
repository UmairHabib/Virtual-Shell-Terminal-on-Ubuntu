# Virtual-Shell-Terminal-on-Ubuntu-OS-used-to-handle-all-commands,Pipes and I/O Redirection

Virtual shell for handling all the commands, Pipes and I/O redirections on Ubuntu. A detailed question is given in pictures


Some Basic Decription of Code:

    Our main task was to develop a virtual shell using different builtin in libraries in Operating System. Our vitual shell can perform all basic tasks of same as given in ubuntu named as terminal. It can perform :
    ls, mkdir, rmdir, cp, clear, cat, grep and many more.

    Moreover, our extended shell can handle Pipes and I/O redirection. Along with Pipes, our code has to handle the output by flushing it to console and in case of grep it can also flush the output into text file. Basically, it can handle two to three pipes at a time.
    Your shell shall execute the following commands, for example:

    ls | grep "out" | more

    and

    ls | grep "out" > "xyz.txt"
